# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
In this project, you will implement your learnings to identify credit card customers that are most likely to churn. The completed project will include a Python package for a machine learning project that follows coding (PEP8) and engineering best practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested). The package will also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the command-line interface (CLI).

## Files and data description
Here is the file structure available to you in the workspace next.

.
├── Guide.ipynb          # Given: Getting started and troubleshooting tips
├── churn_notebook.ipynb # Given: Contains the code to be refactored
├── churn_library.py     # ToDo: Define the functions
├── churn_script_logging_and_tests.py # ToDo: Finish tests and logs
├── README.md            # ToDo: Provides project overview, and instructions to use the code
├── data                 # Read this data
│   └── bank_data.csv
├── images               # Store EDA results 
│   ├── eda
│   └── results
├── logs				 # Store logs
└── models               # Store models
The Guide.ipynb and churn_notebook.ipynb will be your starting point for the project.

## Running Files
To run churn_library.py file, run below command:
```ipython churn_library.py```
Then, train and test results will be printed out on the terminal with resultant images in 'images/eda' and 'images/results' directories.

To run chrun_script_logging_and_tests.py file, run below command:
```ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py```
Then, train and test results will be printed out on the terminal with resultant images in 'images/eda' and 'images/results' directories with resultant log messages in 'logs/churn_library.log'.
